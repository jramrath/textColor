GitHub: https://github.com/jramrath/textColor

PiPy: https://pypi.org/project/textColor/


# Installation

This library is hosted on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/textColor/). You can install it with **pip**:

`pip install textColor`


# Usage

To use this library, you first have to import it:
```
from textColor import tc
```

To print colored text do the following:
```
print(tc.green("GREEN"))           # 'GREEN' will be green
print(tc.green("RED"))             # 'RED' will be red
print(tc.green("BLUE"))            # 'BLUE' will be blue
print(tc.green("YELLOW"))          # 'YELLOW' will be yellow
```

You can also use special 'pre-fixes':
```
print(tc.input("Name: "))          # will output '[?] Name: '  while '[?]' is yellow
print(tc.info("Info"))             # will output '[-] Info'    while '[-]' is blue
print(tc.error("ERROR"))           # will output '[!] ERROR'   while '[!]' is red
print(tc.output("Success"))        # will output '[>] Success' while '[>]' is green
```
